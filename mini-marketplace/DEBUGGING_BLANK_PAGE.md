# 🐛 Debugging Blank Page Issue

## Current Status

✅ **Fixed**: Removed all duplicate `.js` files  
✅ **Verified**: All `.tsx` files are in place  
✅ **Confirmed**: Dev server is running without build errors  
❌ **Issue**: Browser shows blank page

## What We Need

To fix the blank page, I need to see the **browser console error**.

### How to Check Browser Console:

1. **Open your browser** at `http://localhost:5173/`
2. **Press F12** (or right-click anywhere → "Inspect")
3. **Click the "Console" tab**
4. **Look for red error messages**
5. **Copy the entire error message** and send it to me

### What the Error Might Look Like:

```
❌ Uncaught Error: Cannot find module '@tanstack/react-query'
❌ Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
❌ Failed to fetch dynamically imported module
❌ Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined
```

## Once You Send the Error:

I'll be able to:
1. Identify the exact issue
2. Fix it immediately
3. Get your app running

## Alternative: Screenshot

If you can't copy the error, take a screenshot of the console tab and share it.
